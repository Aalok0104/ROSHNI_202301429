## **Summary and Insights**

- On our visit to disaster control room, some observations that we made were as follows:
    - Use of log books and paper is very high.
    - Very little use of modern tech was seen.
    - There were around 6-7 telephones to collect distress calls as well as to contact other disaster control rooms of nearby districts.
    - At max 3 distress calls can be taken parallely.
- 112 distress calls are addressed to the headquaters directly instead of the disaster control room. The distress helpline is different.
- At any given time, any report that is made is provided to the police/fire department or any other concerned authority.
- If any call is made directly to the police or other authority they inform the DCR official as well.
- 3 officials work in 8 hour shifts during a day.
- These officials use Rahat portal to update the rainfall data every 2 hours.
- Any call taken during a day is logged into a book by hand by these officials.
- State Disaster Resource Network (SDRN) is used by Maulik sir to plan and manage disasters better.
- Regular mock drills take place to keep the communication gaps as small as possible and leave no room for error.
- Maulik sir agreed to guide and help us in future to develop the app and provide insights on the workings as well.
